<h2>Booking your Campsite</h2>

<p>Before camping in Girraween, you will need to make a booking and pay your camping fees to obtain a camping permit and tag.</p>

<p>Camping permits are required for both of the developed camping grounds and the seven bush camping sites.  When booking, you must choose either a tent or camper trailer/caravan site. The tag with your booking number must be displayed at your camp site.</p>

<p>There is often high demand for camping areas during peak periods, such as public holidays and school holidays. To avoid disappointment, please book early. Booking at least six weeks in advance is recommended, but you may be able to book up to 12 months in advance.  You must pay your camping fees to secure your booking.</p>

<p>Self-registration upon arrival is no longer available at Girraween National Park, so you need to make your booking ahead of time.</p>
