<h2>During your Stay</h2>

<p>Please help us care for Girraween National Park by observing a few simple rules.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Never feed, chase or scare native animals. Bring your camera and binoculars for viewing wildlife. A torch, preferably with a red filter to protect animals' eyes, is useful for spotlighting at night.</li>
<li>Remember everything in Girraween National Park (living or dead) is protected &ndash; including wildflowers, wildlife, fungi and lichen, and even rocks and timber.</li>
<li>Do not use soap and detergent in Girraween National Park's creeks and waterholes as they pollute the water.</li>
<li>Keep to the designated walking tracks. These tracks are designed to have minimal impact on the environment and will lead you to the more outstanding features without damaging the park.</li>
<li>Be tidy. Please take all your rubbish and recyclables away from the park for proper disposal.</li>
</ul>
