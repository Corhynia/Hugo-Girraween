<h2>The Camping Areas</h2>

<p>The Bald Rock Creek camping area is first on the left as you enter Girraween National Park from the New England Highway. Castle Rock camping area is further on, about 100m past the Visitor Information Centre and on the right.</p>

<p>Sites aren't numbered or pre-allocated in either camping area, so you will need to choose your site on arrival.</p>

<p>Both camping grounds have open areas without separately defined sites.  In some cases it's not possible to drive right up next to your campsite, so it may be necessary to park a short distance away.</p>

<p>The camping areas are semi-grassed and semi-shaded, with some sites allowing full sun for solar power availability.  The ground surface is hard, decomposed granite soil.</p>

<p>Rubbish bins are not provided. Please bring rubbish bags and take all recyclables and rubbish with you when you leave.</p>

<p>There are no powered sites at Girraween.  Generators are not permitted.</p>

<p>It is preferable that you use fuel or gas stoves.</p>

<p>Open fires are only permitted in the barbecues provided (except when fire bans or prohibitions apply). Please bring your own wood. Firewood may be purchased from the Ballandean Store on the New England Highway (15 km from the park).  Never collect wood or kindling from the bush or roadside (fines apply).  Fires should not be left unattended.  Keep your fires below the grate and make sure your fire is out before you leave it. All barbecue ashes need to be disposed of appropriately (wetted down and taken to a waste transfer station). Ash must not be dumped in the camping area or bush.</p>

<p>There is no shop in the national park, so if you wish to purchase ice, drinks or fuel, the closest providers are back towards Ballandean or south to Wallangarra (10 minutes way from the park Visitor Information Centre). Drinks may be purchased from The Chocolate Shop on Pyramids Road (4 kilometres from the park).</p>

<p>There is a public telephone in the Visitor Information Centre car park. Mobile phone coverage is not reliable in Girraween National Park, but may be possible in areas with high elevation or westwards towards the New England Highway. QldParks wi-fi is available at the Girraween Visitor Centre.</p>

<p>Please do not bring pets into the national park. Domestic animals can distress or kill native animals.  Some native animals, like the Eastern Grey Kangaroo and Common Brushtail Possum are quite used to people and regularly venture into the camping areas. Kookaburras, Magpies, Red Wattlebirds and Currawongs are also frequent visitors.</p>
