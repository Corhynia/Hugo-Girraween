<h2>Gallery</h2>

<p>Girraween is famous for its spectacular Spring wildflower display, its majestic granite domes, balancing boulders and towering tors.  Water is also an attraction, as the park is graced by white cascades tumbling over rocks and dark, silent pools mirroring the sky above.</p>

<p>There is also beauty on a smaller scale.  Delicate ferns curl upwards from the forest floor and colourful lichens splotch granite and bark alike. Bright birds, jewel-like beetles, lacy lizards and shy wallabies bring the bush to wonderful life.</p>

<p>Together, plants and animals, water and stone weave their special magic that is Girraween.</p>
