<h2>What's New 2018</h2>
<p><b>13 September, 2018</b></p>
<p>You might have noticed that there haven't been many updates to this website these past couple of years and none this year.  The site is by no means dead, it's just that we have been very busy doing other things, such as traveling overseas.</p>
<p>Another thing that has made me reluctant to add new material to the website is that technology has changed and the system behind it is obsolete and needs to be updated. This will not be a trivial task!</p>
<p>We are currently in the process of moving house. I am very much looking forward to getting back into the website once again once that is done and the dust has settled.</p>

<p>Girraween continues to inspire me and I hope to continue to spread the word about it for many years to come.</p>
